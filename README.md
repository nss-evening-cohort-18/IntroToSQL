# IntroToSQL

You can use the `Creation.sql` script to create a copy of the database with some starter data.

There are a few practice scripts in the `Practice.sql` file that give examples of both LEFT JOIN as well as INNER JOIN.
Look it over until you get an idea of what's happening!  When you try to execute a command, it will ask you to pick a server to connect to.
After that make sure to pick the `IntroToSQL` database from the dropdown at the top of the text editor window.
